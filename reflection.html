		  <h3>Reflection on Unit 1</h3>
		  </header>
                  <p>Unit 1 of the module focused on an introduction into Cybersecurity. A good understanding of the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability) triad was gained as well as regulations such as the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). These regulations are not enforced in South Africa and therefore it was very new to me. I was particularly amazed by the data presented in the Cyber Security Breaches Survey 2020 which outlined data breaches across organisations in the UK. This was also a week where my ePortfolio structure was researched and developed. Further reading into Cybersecurity concepts was performed as well a refresher on the networking concepts which I had previously learnt. An initial post discussing why Cyber Security is now a global issue and why it is important for companies to invest in Cyber Security was also written. I thoroughly enjoyed reading various research journals which aided in the writing of the initial post.</p>

		  <h3>Reflection on Unit 2</h3>
		  </header>
                  <p>Most of the time during Unit 2 was spent reading initial posts posted by students on the topic of cybersecurity being a global issue as well as responding to these in the form of Peer Responses. It was great to study the initial posts of my fellow colleagues and learn from them as well. A total of 3 peer responses was provided by myself. These posts can be viewed by clicking on the links below:

Unit 2 also focused on preparing for the first Seminar where Shell Global as a case study was discussed. Research was performed on Shell Global on the topic of security concerns experienced by the company. I thoroughly enjoyed attending the first seminar as it brought some perspective into the world of Cybersecurity as well as understanding the views of my peers. Knowledge that was gained during Unit 1 & 2 of the Module was applied to the case study as well, this aided in the understanding of various concepts and regulations.</p>

		<p></p>
		  <header class="major">
		  <h3>Reflection on Unit 3</h3>
		  </header>
                  <p>Unit 3 focused on approaches to cyber security design. Two great books were presented as essential reading materials i.e.</p>
		  <p>Anderson, R. (2008) Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems. 2nd ed. Wiley Publishing Inc.</p>
		  <p>Howard M. and LeBlanc. D. (2003) Writing Secure Code. 2nd ed. Microsoft Press.</p>
		  <p>The two books really opened my mind on the concept of cybersecurity and its applications. They are great reads and I would recommend them to anyone studying Cyber security or even people in general wanting to know more about the topic.</p>
		  <p>The lecturecast presented was very information touching on the following areas:</p>
		   <ul>
                  <li>Approaches to security,</li>
                  <li>Types of threats,</li>
	          <li>Types of network security,</li>
	          <li>Software security,</li>
		  <li>Threat modelling techniques,</li>
	          <li>Impact assessment of the threat,</li>   
		  <li>Security solutions and their implementation considerations,</li> 
			 <li>Tips for security design solutions.</li> 
		  </ul>
			<p>This was also the week where a summary post based on the previous units learnings was due. By this time I had become quite proficient in the Harvard referencing style as well.</p>

		<p></p>
		  <header class="major">
		  <h3>Reflection on Unit 4</h3>
		  </header>
                  <p>The focus this week involved applying modelling techniques to identify threats and vulnerabilities in networks. Further reading was performed from the following book:</p>
		  <p>Howard M. and LeBlanc. D. (2003). Writing Secure Code. 2nd ed. Microsoft Press.</p>
			<p>The following important points were extracted:</p>	
				<p>"By secure software, we don’t mean security code or code that implements security features. We mean code that is designed to with- stand attack by malicious attackers. Secure code is also robust code.
If you create an application that runs on one or more computers connected to a network or the biggest network of them all, the Internet, your code will be attacked."</p>
			<p>Howard & LeBlanc (2003) further mentions the reasons why people choose not to build secure systems are as follows:</p>
		     <ul>
                    <li>Security is boring.</li>
                    <li>Security is often seen as a functionality disabler, as something that gets in the way.</li>
                    <li>Security is difficult to measure.</li>
			<li>Security is usually not the primary skill or interest of the designers and developers creating the product.</li>     
			     <li>Security means not doing something exciting and new.</li>
                  </ul>   
									<p>A seminar was held this week as well which focused on working through an example of a web-based information system called PACS (Picture Archiving Communications System). Potential threats were identified using threat modelling techniques such as Abuse cases, Attack tree's and STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service and Elevation of Privilege). Once again, a great learning experience from the seminar.</p>
