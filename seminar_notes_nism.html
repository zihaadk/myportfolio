									<p>Then consider the following:</p>

									<p>“Would the Internet we have today be much better if it was based on the ISO/ OSI 7-layer model rather than TCP/IP?“</p>

									<p>Also, consider the availability, influence and impact of server and desktop tools and environments and where they came from (Commercial sources vs. Open source).</p>

                  							<li>Which of the standards discussed in the sources above would apply to the website/ organisation assigned to you for the assessment? For example, a company providing services to anyone living in Europe or a European-based company or public body would most likely be subject to GDPR. A company handling online payments would most likely need to meet PCI-DSS standards.</li>
	          							<li>Evaluate your assigned website against the appropriate standards and decide how you would check if standards were being met?</li>

										<h3>Seminar 7 Preparation</h3>

									<p>Read the following two articles.</p>
									<p>Rawat, D. & Reddy, S. (2017). Software Defined Networking Architecture, Security and Energy Efficiency: A Survey. IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials 19(1):325-346.</p>
									<p>Ding, W., Yan, Z. & Deng, R. (2016) A Survey on Future Internet Security Architectures. IEEE Access.</p>
									<p>Your tutor will split you into 4 teams and then you will debate the following questions:<p>
									<p>Team 1: It is our belief that the future of the Internet is based on content centric networking (CCN &/or NDN or COAST).<p>
									<p>Team 2: It is our belief that the future of the Internet is based on peer-to-peer overlay-based networking (BitTorrent, TOR, Freenet, KAD).<p>
									<p>Team 3: It is our belief that the future of the Internet is based on the MobilityFirst architecture.<p>
									<p>Team 4: It is our belief that the future of the Internet is based on the adoption of IPv6 and the rollout of the associated security measures (DNSSEC, HTTP/3, IPsec, etc.)<p>
									<p>Read all the arguments for each of the four positions. Each team should argue against the other positions and defend why their point of view is correct. Each team member should pick at least one opposing point of view and refute it. During this week’s seminar session, all students will independently vote for which argument they believe was presented most persuasively.</p>

										<h4>Team 1: Content-Centric Networking (CCN)</h4>
									</header>
									
									<p>It is our belief that the future of the Internet is based on content centric networking (CCN)</p>
									<p>The current IPv4 (Internet Protocol) version 4 Internet architecture in use today is based on connection between hosts using source and destination IP addresses. Network attacks, depletion of IP addresses, increased latency in serving content are amongst the many disadvantages that IPv4 offers (Ding et al., 2016). There are various research projects being funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) to present alternatives to the current architecture. One of these alternatives is called Content-Centric Networking (CCN) a form of Information Centric Networks (ICN) which is primarily based on content cache and delivery. The CCN architecture has 3 layers viz. Network Provider Infrastructure Layer, Services Aware Layer, and the Information Overlay Layer (Ding et al., 2016). Furthermore, endpoints connect to each other on named data instead of IP addresses (Arokiaraj & Muthumani, 2020). Some of the advantages of this architecture include:</p>
									<ul>
									
                  							<li>Attack detection and verification of all packets</li>

									<li>Network load reduction</li>	
									<li>Enhance router storage (cache)</li>
									<li>Shorter downloading times as well as low communication overheads (Mishra & Dave, 2015)</li>
		  							</ul>
									<p>In conclusion, CCN is proving to be beneficial for current network architectures as well as being a promising alternative to IP driven networks. Various caching strategies are being researched to enhance this architecture (Mishra & Dave, 2015).</p>
