										<h3>Viruses</h3>
									</header>
									<p>One common type of attack is a virus. Viruses are pieces of code normally embedded in hooks (such as email attachments) which when opened by users can cause the computer not to function normally – the computer behaves like someone else has taken charge of it.</p>
									<header class="major">
										<h3>Malware</h3>
									</header>
									<p>This is also known as malicious software with different types such as spyware, ransomware or adware. Behaviours include installing itself and running as a piece of software, unlike viruses which tend to embed themselves in the computer's operating system. For example, the Stuxnet is a type of malware that seeks to attack and  take over critical industries such as power productions and electric grids and defence. Malware can close computer networks.  The British National Health System (NHS) was recently hit by a ransomware (WannaCry) which disabled access to their information system (Smart, 2018). An example of a ransomware is WannaCry. Spyware, ransomware and adware aren’t really interchangeable – they’re all flavours of malware rather than equivalents.</p>
