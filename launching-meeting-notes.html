										<h3>Malware</h3>
									</header>
									<p>This is also known as malicious software with different types such as spyware, ransomware or adware. Behaviours include installing itself and running as a piece of software, unlike viruses which tend to embed themselves in the computer's operating system. For example, the Stuxnet is a type of malware that seeks to attack and  take over critical industries such as power productions and electric grids and defence. Malware can close computer networks.  The British National Health System (NHS) was recently hit by a ransomware (WannaCry) which disabled access to their information system (Smart, 2018). An example of a ransomware is WannaCry. Spyware, ransomware and adware aren’t really interchangeable – they’re all flavours of malware rather than equivalents.</p>

										<h1>Launching into Cyber Security - Discussion Collaboration</h1>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Launch1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<header class="major">
										<h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Discuss why Cyber Security is now a global issue and why it is important for companies to invest in Cyber Security. Your discussion could consider the following: the economic benefits to companies, the implications of a breach of regulations and laws such as reputational damage and trust and business competitiveness. Identify a typical global company and describe the nature of the business to set the context for the discussion.</p>

										<h3>Initial Post</h3>

							                <p>Cybersecurity is one of the fastest growing industries globally, as supported by Plachkinova and Pittz (2021). The demand for cybersecurity is due to the increase in cyber-attacks and data breaches to companies around the world. Cyber-attacks pose a threat to companies as they migrate to the digital online world. Furthermore, the risk of cyber-attacks is intensified through the use of IoT (Internet of Things) devices connected to the internet (Danso, 2021). According to the Global Risks Report 2021 approximately 40% of the World Economic Forum (WEF) respondents forecasted that cybersecurity will become a critical threat to the world within the next two years affecting the global economy (Mclennan, 2021).</p>
									
									<p>In November 2018 Marriott International (a US-based hospitality company) announced a data breach in their network affecting approximately 500 million guests. Marriot acquired Starwood in the year 2016 however according to Marriott’s investigation led by cyber security experts’; hackers gained unauthorized access to the Starwood network in 2014 (Starwood hotels, 2018). This is a typical example of an Advance Persistent Threat (APT) attack where hackers gain access to the network and remain hidden for a long period of time to gather information (Danso, 2021). According to VanSyckel (2018) APT attacks tend to be the most dangerous form of cyber-attacks. Personal Identifiable Information (PII) such as credit card details, travel itineraries, passport numbers, etc. of Starwood’s client base were exposed. As a result of the data breach, a fine amounting $122 million was imposed on Marriott by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) authority (Daigle & Khan, 2020).</p>
									
									<p>Cyber-attacks are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated in the present day affecting the global economy. The acts of cyber criminals’ results in companies losing millions in revenue every year (Lewis & Crumpler, 2019) as confirmed in the Marriott case study. This warrants companies and organizations the demand to invest in cybersecurity practices to predict, prevent, detect, and respond to possible cyber-attacks efficiently and successfully. Fines imposed by the GDPR authority are hefty and the reputational damage, financial loss and customer confidence to any organization can be detrimental to its success.</p>

										<h3>Summary Post</h3>
									</header>
							                <p>As the world progressively relies on online technologies and as organisations move swiftly into the digital era, the importance of cybersecurity becomes a key focus area. Cybersecurity can be considered as the practice of ensuring Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA) of information. Confidentiality refers to the controlled access to information, Integrity refers to data that should not be altered in any way and Availability refers to the reliability and uninterrupted access to data (Danso, 2021).</p>
									
									<p>The Cyber Security Breaches Survey 2020 confirms that data breaches are ever-increasing. A major contributor worldwide is the rise in the use of IoT (Internet of Things) devices elaborated in detail in a peer response by Onyeemeosi (2021). According to Kaplan et al. (2019) when companies purchase IoT devices, strong cybersecurity controls is considered first.</p>
									
									<p>Data breaches can have a range of damaging consequences to any organisation as observed in the collaborate learning discussions as well as in the case of Marriott International (Starwood hotels, 2018). Various known attacks are still being used such as Malware (malicious software), Spear Phishing (targeting a specific individual), Advance Persistent Threats (hackers remain hidden collecting data to further infiltrate), etc. Ranson (2021) highlights the detail of Spear phishing and its effects on organisations. Madrid (2021) delves deep into APT attacks and the protection mechanisms that organisations should introduce to mitigate these attacks - a view that the writer agrees with. These attacks can severely damage a company’s reputation as well as destroy its competitive advantage.</p>
								
									<p>Research suggests that cybersecurity affects the global economy. While companies continue to invest in the latest cybersecurity technologies (Grand View Research, 2021), this will not ensure that companies are 100% cyber-attack proof (VanSyckel, 2018). It is therefore important to understand cyber-risks as well as create a cybersecurity culture within the organisation that shares a common way of thinking; in doing so security across the entire organisation is enhanced (Boehm et al., 2019).</p>
