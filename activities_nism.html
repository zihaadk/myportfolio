										<h2>Practical Activity - Scanning Exercise</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Using your assigned website, carry out the following exercises reporting on the questions listed below.</p>

                  <p>Perform a basic scan using standard tools such as traceroute (not ICMP version). Use these basic tools to compile a list that details the following information:</p>
                  						
                  <ul>
										<li>How many hops from your machine to your assigned website?</li>
  									<li>Which step causes the biggest delay in the route? What is the average duration of that delay?</li>
										<li>What are the main nameservers for the website?</li>
                    <li>Who is the registered contact?</li>
                    <li>What is the MX record for the website?</li>
                    <li>Where is the website hosted?</li>

										<h2>e-Portfolio Activity - Kali Linux</h2>

									<p>Read the following articles on Kali Linux:</p>
									<p>Leroux, S. (2020) The Kali Linux Review You Must Read Before You Start Using It. It's FOSS. Available from: https://itsfoss.com/kali-linux-review/</p>
									<p>Bhatt, D. (2018) Modern Day Penetration Testing Distribution Open Source Platform - Kali Linux - Study Paper. International Journal of Scientific & Technology Research 7(4): 233-237.</p>
								
                  <ul>
                    <li>What does the article teach you about carrying out vulnerability scans using Kali?</li>
                    <li>What issues might you encounter?</li>
                    <li>How would you overcome them?</li>

                  </ul>

							<ul>
                    <li>How do their results compare with your initial evaluation?</li>
                    <li>What do you think of their criteria?</li>

                  </ul>		
		 <p>“Kali Linux is a well-respected collection of open source pen testing tools, including metasploit, nmap, wireshark and sqlmap amongst many others. It has the benefit of being available as a ‘live distro’ which means that there is no requirement to install it – it will run from a DVD or a USB/ thumb drive. For these reasons, we recommend that Kali Linux is the tool of choice for this assignment.” (UoEO Computing Team, 2020.)</p>
									<p>Based on your evaluation in the previous session and the articles above, consider the recommendation given above:</p>
									
													<ul>
                    <li>What are the pros and cons of using Kali Linux vs. Nessus?</li>
                    <li>Has this changed your original evaluation score?</li>

										<h3>Wiki Entry - Medical Device Security</h3>
									</header>
									
									<p>Hi Team</p>

<p>I came across a very informative research report on connected medical device security. This is a 2020 Research Report titled "Connected Medical Device Security: A Deep Dive into Healthcare Networks" by Forescout Research Labs.</p>

<p>Available from: https://www.forescout.com/resources/connected-medical-device-security-a-deep-dive-into-healthcare-networks/</p>

<p>It is worth a read and contains some very useful information and statistics on medical devices and security.</p>

										<h3>Wiki Entry - Scanning Exercise and Collaborative Learning</h3>
									</header>
									
									<p>Perform scans against your assigned website using the tools available in Kali Linux. Answer as many of the following questions as you can:</p>
									   <ul>
                    								<li>What Operating System does the web site utilise?</li>
                    								<li>What web server software is it running?</li>
                    								<li>Is it running a CMS (Wordpress, Drupal, etc?)</li>
										   <li>What protection does it have (CDN, Proxy, Firewall?)</li>
										   <li>Where is it hosted?</li>
										   <li>Does it have any open ports?</li>
										   <li>Does the site have any known vulnerabilities?</li>
										   <li>What versions of software is it using? Are these patched so that they are up to date?</li>
                  							   </ul>
