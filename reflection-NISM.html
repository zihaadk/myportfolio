		  <h3>Reflection on Unit 1</h3>
		  </header>
                  <p>Unit 1 represented the first week of the Network and Information Security Management course. The basics of information and security management were discussed in this Unit. Having prior experience in networking, I was particularly excited as some of the topics covered would suffice as a good refresher. Students were expected to complete an initial post covering major threats and vulnerabilities as well as mitigation techniques from a paper written by Glisson et al. (2015).</p>
		  <p>Team groups were also established in preparation for the first seminar. I was placed in Group 1 along with 4 other team members. It was also required that we submit a signed team contract before the end of the Unit. Messaging between myself and other team members started on the VLE (Virtual Learning Environment) platform and thereafter moved to e-mails, however this was not effective. For us to collaborate as a team I had set up a Webex space and had invited all team members to download the application. The first meeting was held 2 days after the seminar, the agenda included completing the team contract along with an introduction of each team member. It was very interesting to learn the backgrounds of each team member and how they would add value to the tasks and group as a whole. We had agreed on the various roles within the group, I had taken the role of communication leader responsible for all communication as well as setting up meetings for the group. Coming from a unified communication background, I had experience using collaboration tools such as Webex and had agreed to take up the role. The team contract was finalized and submitted after the meeting.</p>
									<p>Figure 1 below represents the Webex space created for our team:</p>

									<img src="images/ref2.png" alt="Ref 2">
									<p></p>
									<p>As mentioned previously an initial post was also due at the end of the week which involved around 5 hours of research to obtain relevant papers. My knowledge of the medical environment as well as medical technologies was limited, and this task provided a good opportunity to fill that gap. I had learnt about the importance of securing medical devices and the implications of attacks on these devices (Williams & Woodward, 2015).</p>
									<p>In addition, I had planned to draw up an action plan for my e-portfolio during this week however this was not possible due to time constraints. This was then placed on the backlog list for completion during Unit 2.</p>

		  <h3>Reflection on Unit 2</h3>
		  </header>
                  <p>In addition to the essential reading items, Unit 2 of the module involved responding to colleague’s initial posts in the form peer responses. Various research papers and journals were studied in order obtain the relevant information to form constructive peer responses. Some of these include: Sametinger et al. (2015) - Security challenges for medical devices, Williams, P. A., & Woodward, A. J. (2015) - Cybersecurity vulnerabilities in medical devices: a complex environment and multifaceted problem, Wang et al., 2020 - Security of Medical Cyber-physical Systems. Full references for these texts are provided below.</p>
		  <p>The collaborative discussions have been helpful, learning and understanding from my colleagues’ viewpoints. Everyone brings a different perception and angle to the discussion. I have learnt the distinct difference between a threat and vulnerability; this wasn’t clear to me prior to completing the Unit tasks. My knowledge has also expanded regarding the security issues that medical devices face, I had very little knowledge on the technology advancements in this area. I have also learnt how to correctly (in my opinion) perform a DREAD analysis; this was also a new concept for me. From this collaboration task it was clear that I had to perform extensive reading on the topics to fill the knowledge gaps that I had.</p>
		  <p>A seminar was also held during this unit which focused on Microsoft STRIDE and DREAD tools. A presentation was required by each group for discussion during the seminar. I had studied the chapter called Threat Modeling by Meier et al. (2010) and using the table below performed a DREAD analysis.</p>
			<img src="images/ref3.png" alt="Ref 3">
									<p>This was placed in a presentation format for discussion during the team meeting. I had posted this to the other team members in preparation for the upcoming session.</p>
									<img src="images/ref4.png" alt="Ref 4">
									<p></p>	
									<p>During the team meeting it was agreed that we would use my slides to present to the forum in the seminar. As a team, we had analysed the DREAD value ratings and adjusted them accordingly. Based on the feedback from my peers during the session I had felt confident that my understanding of the task required, and dread value ratings were correct. Prior to the team session I could not validate and confirm this.</p>

		  <h3>Reflection on Unit 3</h3>
		  </header>
                  <p>Week 3 focused on the fundamentals of networking and utilizing various scanning tools to perform a scanning exercise against the website assigned. A summary post was required based on the initial post written in week 1 as well as feedback from peers in the form of peer responses. It was very beneficial to read and understand the views of my peers, each person brings a different and unique viewpoint. This aided my understanding regarding threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigation actions in medical devices.</p>						
		  <p>A practical scanning exercise was also required in this unit, this activity provided the opportunity to learn about various scanning tools in the industry. Regarding the team activity, each member produced results in a team discussion. These results were then discussed in a team meeting and aligned. I was very happy with the results I had obtained as it aligned with the rest of the team. The screenshot below provides evidence of my results sent to the team.</p>
			<img src="images/tools2_nism.png" alt="tools 2">
									<p></p>
									<p>Perhaps for future scanning activities, one could use alternative tools to validate these results.

	          <li>Discuss the difference between TCP/IP and the ISO/OSI protocol stacks.</li>
		  </ul> 
		<p></p>
		  <header class="major">
		  <h3>Reflection on Unit 4</h3>
		  </header>
		  <p>Unit 4 dived a bit deeper into network scanning tools. We were asked to analyze the outputs provided by the tools in Unit 3, the analyses were to be posted under the collaborative learning discussion forum as an ‘Initial Post’. Having prior experience working with networking tools I felt this task to be quite familiar and easily achievable. On the contrary after read McNab (2017) I was amazed at what details I was missing when these tools were used. For example, nmap (Network Mapper) was used to determine open ports, however knowing the port 80 is open; one can execute the telnet command and issue a HEAD / HTTP/1.0 request – this reveals that the server is running Apache.</p>
		  <p>In addition, a seminar was held during this unit which focused on the differences between TCP/IP vs. ISO/OSI. Again, having been in the networking industry this provided me with the opportunity to delve a bit deeper into the history of both models and how they came about. I was particularly amazed how politics affected the development of these models (Russell, 2006).</p>

		  <h3>Reflection on Unit 5</h3>
		  </header>
                  <p>The focus of week 5 was based on network protection and various intrusion detection tools. It was also required during this unit that students participate in the collaboration discussion and respond to other colleagues ‘initial post’ in the form of peer responses.  The highlight of this unit for myself was reading the following paper by Niemietz and Schwenk, 2015) titled: Owning Your Home Network: Router Security Revisited. I was amazed at how manufacturers of routers can ship routers out to homes with default passwords being used for the administration interface. Furthermore, these routers were found to be vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross Site Forgery (CSFR) attacks. This research tempted me to look at my own home router configuration and implement some of the recommendations put forward. For example, default router passwords were changed, firmware versions upgraded, and wireless security enhanced by utilizing WPA2 instead of WPA (Wifi Protected Access). I found this exercise to be a very good example of putting theory studied into practice.</p>
