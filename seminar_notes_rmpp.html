										<h3>Seminar 2 Preparation</h3>

									<p>In this seminar, we will be focusing on LO 3 “Evaluate critically existing literature, research design and methodology for the chosen topic.” One way this is done is by conducting a peer review of existing literature on a particular subject.</p>
									<p>In preparation for this week’s seminar, you will need to source at least 2 papers in a Computing field of your choice that utilise the two different types of research methods to achieve their goal/research aims. Now answer the following questions (please provide justifications for your answers) and be prepared to discuss them in the session:</p>
									<ul>
									
                  							<li>Familiarise yourself with the purpose, problem, objective or research question of each paper. Are they in line with your experience or thoughts on the topic, contributing to the collective body of knowledge in this area?</li>
	          							<li>Is the research methodology utilised in each paper appropriate for the stated purpose or question?</li>
										<li>In terms of data collection and analysis, is this also appropriate for the stated purpose or question?</li>
										<li>Does each paper support its claims and conclusions with explicit arguments or evidence?</li>
										<li>How would you enhance the work/paper?</li>

										<h3>Seminar 3 Preparation</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Please read the case below and answer the questions. You need to determine the ethical issues involved with this case.</p>

									<p>Ricardo works for the records department of his local government as a computer records clerk, where he has access to files of property tax records. For a scientific study, a researcher, Beth, has been granted access to the numerical portion “but not the corresponding names” of some records.</p>

									<p>Beth finds some information that she would like to use, but she needs the names and addresses corresponding with certain properties. Beth asks Ricardo to retrieve these names and addresses, so she can contact these people for more information and for permission to do further study.</p>

									<p>Now consider, what are the ethical issues involved in deciding which of these options to pursue?</p>
									
									<ul>
									
                  							<li>If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, should he release the names and addresses?</li>
	          							<li>Suppose Ricardo were responsible for determining allowable access to the files. What ethical issues would be involved in his deciding whether to grant access to Beth?</li>
									<li>Should Beth be allowed to contact the individuals involved? That is, should the Records department release individuals' names to a researcher? What are the ethical issues for the Records department to consider?</li>
			   						<li>Suppose Beth contacts the individuals to ask their permission, and one-third of them respond giving permission, one-third respond denying permission, and one-third do not respond. Beth claims that at least one-half of the individuals are needed to make a valid study. What options are available to Beth?</li>
