									<p>Then consider the following:</p>

									<p>"Would the Internet we have today be much better if it was based on the ISO/ OSI 7-layer model rather than TCP/IP?"</p>

									<p>Also, consider the availability, influence and impact of server and desktop tools and environments and where they came from (Commercial sources vs. Open source).</p>
